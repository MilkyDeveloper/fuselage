# Fuselage
Fuselage is a set of tools to run full-fledged Linux (or virtualized Windows) on (almost) any chromebook without the need to press ```CTRL``` ```D``` every boot.
It uses the Brunch framework to generate a ChromeOS ISO, and then gives instructions on how to flash a full UEFI bios to the chromebook.

### Why not use Crostini or Crouton?
Remember, with the full UEFI bios by MrChromebox, there's not many drivers for most peripherals. What this does is take those drivers of a ChromeOS install and gives you, essentialy, *dev mode* ChromeOS without actually pressing ```CTRL``` ```D``` on every boot. **Note**: in one stage of the install you will need to enter dev mode.
