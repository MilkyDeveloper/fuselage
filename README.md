# Fuselage
Fuselage is a set of tools to run full-fledged Linux (or virtualized Windows) on (almost) any chromebook without the need to press ```CTRL``` ```D``` every boot.
It uses the Brunch framework to generate a ChromeOS ISO, and then gives instructions on how to flash a full UEFI bios to the chromebook.

### Why not use Crostini or Crouton?
Remember, with the full UEFI bios by MrChromebox, there's not many drivers for most peripherals. What this does is take those drivers of a ChromeOS install and gives you, essentialy, *dev mode* ChromeOS without actually pressing ```CTRL``` ```D``` on every boot. **Note**: in one stage of the install you will need to enter dev mode.

## Prerequisites
* Check if your Chromebook is [supported](https://mrchromebox.tech/#devices) by making sure it has a âœ… under your chromebook name and the ```UEFI Firmware
(Full ROM)```
* Intel 7th gen processor or newer / Geminilake
* Order a SuzyQable for 15$ (this allows you to flash a custom bios) from [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14746) or [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/suzyqable-chromeos-debug-cable)

## Installation
First, we need to flash MrChromebox's custom UEFI bios. As ripped from his [guide here](https://wiki.mrchromebox.tech/Firmware_Write_Protect#Disabling_WP_on_CR50_Devices_via_CCD),

> The install seems lengthy but it really isn't if you follow the instructions carefully

### Enable Developer Mode
* Enter Recovery Mode: press/hold ESC and Refresh, then press Power for ~1s; release all 3 keys
* Press CTRL+D to switch to Developer Mode; confirm when prompted
* Press CTRL+D on Developer Mode splash screen to boot in Developer Mode
* On first boot, system will securely wipe all userdata (this takes a few minutes)

### Open CCD
* Open a crosh shell: CTRL+ALT+T and then type in ```shell``` and press enter
* Check the CCD state
```sudo gsctool -a -I```\
The CCD state should be reported as closed
* Open the CCD:
```sudo gsctool -a -o```\
You will be prompted to assert physical presence (PP), which is a fancy way of saying to press the power button. Over the course of ~3 minutes, it will prompt you several times to press the power button. On the last time, the device will abruptly reboot and exit Developer Mode. Switch back to Developer Mode after this.

### Disable WP / Enable Firmware Flashing
At this point, you will need to connect the Suzy-Q cable to your ChromeOS device in a loopback manner - both ends of the cable will be connected to it. The USB-C end needs to be in the debug port (usually the left rear port on devices with multiple USB-C ports) and be facing the correct way (the debug part of the cable is not reversible). The USB-A end of the cable can connect to any open port. On devices with only USB-C ports, an adapter must be used.

* Verify cable connection:
```ls /dev/ttyUSB*```
This command should return 3 items: ttyUSB0, ttyUSB1, and ttyUSB2 \
If not, then your cable is connected to the wrong port or is upside down
* Change to a root shell:
```sudo su -```
* Disable hardware write-protect:\
```echo "wp false" > /dev/ttyUSB0```
```echo "wp false atboot" > /dev/ttyUSB0```
* Enable all CCD functionality always (allows unbricking/recovery in case CCD state is reset):
```echo "ccd reset factory" > /dev/ttyUSB0```
* Verify Changes:
```gsctool -a -I``` \
The CCD state should be opened, and the current value for all CCD flags should be set to Y/Always.
Note: the ccd command shows the current value followed by the default value in parentheses, so you can ignore the latter. \
```crossystem wpsw_cur```
The current WP value should be 0
* Now reboot the system:
```sudo reboot```

Almost done! ðŸŽ‰

### Flashing the firmware
Open the shell (```CTRL``` ```ALT``` ```T```) and then enter ```shell``` in.

Then, punch in:\
```cd; curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh```\
```sudo install -Dt /usr/local/bin -m 755 firmware-util.sh```\
```sudo firmware-util.sh```\

and type in the number corresponding to ```Install/Update UEFI (Full ROM) Firmware```. Note: If the option is greyed out you did something wrong in this guide, redo it **or** double-check if your device is supported.
